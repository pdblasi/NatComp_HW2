\section{Problem 17}

\textbf{Apply the MLP network trained with the backpropagation learning algorithm to solve the character recognition task of Section 4.4.2.} \newline \\
\textbf{Determine a suitable network architecture and then test the resultant network sensitivity to noise the the test data. Test different noise levels, from 5\% to 50\%} \newline \\

Since this problem was extra credit we devoted more time to other problems with the given extension.
